Certainly! Here's a basic template for a README.md file for the DSAPy package:

```markdown
# DSAPy

DSAPy is a Python package that provides implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Installation

You can install DSAPy using pip:

```bash
pip install DSAPy
```

## Features

DSAPy currently includes the following data structures and algorithms:

- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List
- Binary Tree
- Graph
- Searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search)
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort)

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use DSAPy:

```python
from DSAPy.dataStructure import Stack, Queue, LinkedList, Tree, Graph

# Create a stack
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 2

# Create a queue
queue = Queue()
queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 1

# Create a linked list
linked_list = LinkedList()
linked_list.add_first(1)
linked_list.add_last(2)
linked_list.print_list()  # Output: 1 2

# Create a binary tree
tree = Tree()
tree.add(5)
tree.add(3)
tree.add(8)
tree.print_tree()  # Output: 3 5 8

# Create a graph
graph = Graph()
graph.add_vertex('A')
graph.add_vertex('B')
graph.add_edge('A', 'B')
graph.print_graph()  # Output: A : ['B']
```
